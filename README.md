Objective:

The objective of data preprocessing before applying AI algorithms is crucial because raw data often contains noise, inconsistencies, or irrelevant information. By preprocessing the data, we ensure that it is in a clean, consistent, and suitable format for the AI models to learn from. Proper preprocessing improves model performance, reduces training time, and leads to more reliable predictions.
